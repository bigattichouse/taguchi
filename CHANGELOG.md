## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- **Python bindings** (`bindings/python/`): `Experiment` and `Analyzer` classes
  wrapping the `taguchi` CLI via subprocess. Installable as a Python package
  via `pip install bindings/python/`. Includes `demo.py` and full README.
- **Python bindings test suite** (`bindings/python/tests/`): 109 tests covering
  CLI discovery, run generation, effects parsing, context manager cleanup,
  recommend_optimal correctness, and full end-to-end workflows.

### Fixed (Python bindings)
- `_find_cli`: string `cli_path` was not wrapped in `Path()` before calling
  `.exists()` — caused `AttributeError` when an explicit path was provided
- `Experiment._initialize()`: crashed with bare `ValueError` on empty factor
  dict instead of raising `TaguchiError`
- `Analyzer.recommend_optimal()`: sorted factor levels alphabetically, which
  misaligned them with OA level indices (L1/L2/L3 = definition order) and
  returned the wrong optimal level

### Hardened (Python bindings)
- **Input validation**: `add_factor()` now rejects empty names, names containing
  `=`, `#`, `:`, spaces, or commas; rejects empty level lists and non-string values
- **Resource safety**: `Experiment` and `Analyzer` both have `__del__` finalizers
  so temporary files are cleaned up even when context managers are not used;
  public `cleanup()` / `get_tgu_path()` API replaces private `_ensure_tgu_file()`
- **Metric passthrough**: `effects()` now correctly passes `--metric <name>` to
  the CLI (was silently omitted, meaning custom metric names were ignored)
- **Empty-results guard**: `main_effects()` raises `TaguchiError("No results added")`
  immediately instead of producing a cryptic CLI error
- **Subprocess timeout**: all CLI calls time out after 30 s with a clear error
- **Cross-platform CLI discovery**: replaced `which taguchi` with `shutil.which()`
- **`from_tgu` robustness**: now strips inline `#` comments, skips blank lines,
  and raises `TaguchiError` if no factors are found (was silently empty)
- **Effects parser**: regex now handles negative and scientific-notation level
  means; raises if CLI output produces no parseable effects
- **`list-arrays` parser**: raises if output contains no recognisable array lines
- **`demo.py`**: updated to use context managers — the canonical example no
  longer demonstrates a resource leak

## [v1.4.1] - 2026-03-03
### Fixed
- **Effects bucketing bug with duplicate factor value strings**: when a factor
  lists duplicate value strings to fill a multi-level OA column (e.g.
  `["lo","lo","lo","med","med","med","hi","hi","hi"]` for a 9-level paired
  column), the analyzer's string-matching loop always found the first
  occurrence of each string, leaving most level buckets at 0.0 and wildly
  understating effect magnitudes. Fixed by storing the post-modulo OA level
  index in `ExperimentRun.level_indices[]` at generation time and using it
  directly in `calculate_main_effects()` instead of scanning for a string match.
### Tests
- `analyzer_duplicate_values_9level`: L81, 3-unique-of-9 factor regression test
- `analyzer_duplicate_values_5level`: L25, 3-unique-of-5 factor regression test
- Total: 108 tests passing, valgrind clean

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-03-03
### Fixed
- **Multi-column CSV support for `effects` and `analyze`**: the CSV parser in both
  commands previously assumed a strict two-column `run_id,response` layout. When a
  results file contains additional factor columns or multiple metric columns (e.g.
  `run_id,endpoint_type,system_COP,heating_COP,T_fridge_C,Qh_W`), the old parser
  would hit a non-numeric second column and fail with "Invalid response value". The
  parser now reads the CSV header, locates the column whose name matches `--metric`,
  and extracts only that column's values — all other columns are ignored. Backward
  compatibility with headerless CSVs and the default `response` column name is
  preserved.

### Added
- `tests/test_csv_multicolumn.sh`: 14 shell-based integration tests covering named
  metric extraction, two-column backward compatibility, headerless CSVs, end-to-end
  value checks, and expected-failure error messages.
- `Makefile`: `make test` now also runs the CSV multi-column shell tests and adds
  the CLI binary as a dependency of the test target.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-03-01
### Security
- **Dynamic file reading**: `.tgu` files are now read into heap-allocated buffers
  (fseek/ftell/malloc) instead of a fixed 4096-byte stack buffer — no file size
  limit, no silent truncation errors
- **Replaced `putenv(strdup())` with `setenv()`** in `cmd_run`: the old pattern
  leaked memory and passed raw pointers into the environment; `setenv()` copies
  the string safely. Factor names containing `=` are now rejected to prevent
  environment block corruption
- **CSV line buffer**: raised from 1024 to 4096 bytes with explicit truncation
  detection — malformed long lines now produce a clear error instead of silent
  mis-parse
- **16 new security tests** in `tests/test_security.c` covering: oversized factor
  names, oversized level values, too many factors, level count cap, null/empty
  inputs, special characters (`=`, shell metacharacters) in factor names, large
  valid inputs, and error buffer null-termination

### Changed
- **Static CLI binary**: `taguchi` now links against `libtaguchi.a` instead of
  `libtaguchi.so` — no runtime shared library dependency (`ldd` shows only libc)
- **Makefile `install-cli` target**: installs only the binary; nothing else needed
  since it is statically linked. `make install` (full install with shared lib +
  headers) remains available for language binding users
- **`make test`** no longer prefixes the unit test runner with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  (it links objects directly); the integration test still uses it as it exercises
  the shared library

## [v1.2.0] - 2026-02-22
### Changed
- **Project Structure**: Reorganized for cleaner separation of concerns
  - Moved all test files to `tests/` directory (including `test_integration.c`)
  - Moved documentation summaries to `docs/` directory
  - All build artifacts (objects, libraries, binaries) now in `build/`
  - Added `make install` and `make reinstall` targets for system installation

### Added
- `make install PREFIX=<path>` - Install library, headers, and CLI binary
- `make reinstall` - Uninstall then reinstall (useful for updates)
- `make uninstall` - Remove installed files

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-02-15
### Added
- **Large Orthogonal Arrays**: L81 (81 runs, 40 columns) and L243 (243 runs, 121 columns) via GF(3) algorithmic generation
- **Column Pairing**: Multi-level factors (4-27 levels) automatically use paired/tripled OA columns
- **Mixed-Level Support**: Factors with different level counts in the same experiment via modular wrapping
- **Main Effects Analysis**: Full working `calculate_main_effects()` using actual OA design mapping
- **Optimal Recommendations**: `recommend_optimal_levels()` for both maximize and minimize objectives
- **CLI `analyze` command**: Full analysis with main effects table and optimal configuration
- **CLI `effects` command**: Display main effects table from results CSV
- **CSV Results Parsing**: `run_id,response` format with header and comment support
- **Effects JSON Serialization**: `taguchi_effects_to_json()` for language bindings
- **Analyzer Tests**: 10 new tests covering result sets, main effects, recommendations, paired columns
- **Generation Tests**: 16 new tests for column pairing, triple pairing, mixed-level balance, L243

### Changed
- L27 now generated algorithmically via GF(3)^3 (was buggy hardcoded data with 450 orthogonality failures)
- `list-arrays` CLI now shows rows, columns, and levels for each array
- `MAX_LEVELS` increased from 5 to 27 (supports up to 3^3 levels via triple-column pairing)
- `MAX_FACTORS` increased from 16 to 41 (L81 has 40 columns)
- `taguchi_create_result_set()` cleaned up (was double-create/free mess)
- All analysis API stubs in `taguchi.c` replaced with working implementations
- Column ordering in GF(3) generator places unit vectors first for linear independence

### Fixed
- L27 orthogonal array data (replaced with verified GF(3)^3 generation)
- Analyzer now uses actual OA design mapping instead of placeholder `(run_id-1) % level_count`
- Triple column pairing correctness (column reordering ensures linear independence)
