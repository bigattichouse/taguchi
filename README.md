# Robust

A small, fast, POSIX-compliant suite of command-line tools for designing and
analyzing robust experiments — screening, variance attribution, optimization,
response surfaces and robust parameter design — built in C over a shared
`libdoe` core.

                              ROBUST — and does it survive what you can't control?
```

Each stage narrows the question and spends more runs on fewer factors. **That
order is the method**: an exhaustive search over everything is exactly what
this suite exists to avoid.

`robust` runs the first two stages as one command. `report` turns any of it into
a page you can hand someone.

## The binaries

| Binary | Role |
|---|---|
| `morris`  | screening — μ\* (importance), σ (interaction flag), group screening |
| `sobol`   | variance attribution — Sᵢ, S_Tᵢ, second-order pairs |
| `ofat`    | one-factor-at-a-time confirmation — is that effect real? |
| `grid`    | small full-factorial — resolve an interaction exactly |
| `taguchi` | orthogonal arrays: optimize, `confirm` a prediction, `robust` design |
| `rsm`     | response surface — quadratic fit, stationary point, canonical analysis (ridges) |
| `pareto`  | multi-objective frontier — filter + accumulating `.front` store |
| `desire`  | Derringer–Suich desirability — several metrics into one |
| `regress` | SRC/SRRC + R² — the *direction* of each effect |
| `uq`      | output distribution — percentiles, histogram, skew |
| `report`  | self-contained HTML — Pareto chart of effects |
| `robust`  | funnel orchestrator — screen → attribute in one command |

Every tool but one takes the shared `.space` factor format. `taguchi` uses
`.tgu`, which adds the orthogonal array and the `noise:` section a crossed
design needs. All of them share a C core
(`core/libdoe`) holding the PRNG, sampling, factor scaling, the fork/env run-loop,
CSV, JSON reading and writing, and stats. See **[STATUS.md](STATUS.md)** for where things stand and what is next,
**[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)** for the full plan, and
**[EXPANSION.md](EXPANSION.md)** for the methods roadmap beyond it.

## Building

```bash
make                # build libdoe and all twelve binaries into build/bin/
make test           # every suite, then valgrind (fails the build on a leak)
make test-asan      # the same suites under ASan/UBSan
make test-bindings  # the Python binding's suite
make fuzz           # seedable fuzz of every parser that reads untrusted input
make validate       # reproduce published results against closed-form ground truth
make coverage       # line/function/branch coverage (needs gcovr for totals)
make clean
```

`make test` runs valgrind when it is present and says plainly when it is not —
a skipped memory check is never reported as a pass. `make validate` is separate
from `make test` because it pins the *claims* the roadmap rests on rather than
our code; see [validation/](validation/README.md).

`make` builds `libdoe` and every tool binary into `build/bin/`. **`taguchi` is a
peer like any other** — this Makefile compiles it, there is no sub-make, and its
two suites are part of `make test`, so they get the same valgrind and ASan/UBSan
discipline as everything else. `make install` covers the whole suite.

## Layout — one directory per stage of use

Directories are named for **what you do** at that point in the funnel, so a new
tool has an obvious home the moment you know which question it answers.

```
core/         libdoe — PRNG, sampling, .space parsing + scaling, fork/env
              runner, results CSV, JSON, stats. Every tool builds on it.

screen/       morris/            "which factors matter at all?"
attribute/    sobol/             "how much variance, and which interactions?"
resolve/      ofat/  grid/       "is that effect real, and who does it pair with?"
optimize/     taguchi/  rsm/     "what is the best, most robust setting?"

analyze/      pareto/  regress/  uq/  report/  desire/
              consume results — no new sampling, no model runs

orchestrate/  robust/            drives the whole funnel, emits the report

examples/     cookies/           the worked example, and the tests that keep
                                 every command in it honest

validation/   reproduces published results against closed-form ground truth
sources/      reference papers, with an errata directory for one of them
spec/         .bp specifications, blueprints, the screening-methods field guide
```

The split that matters: **`analyze/` consumes results; every other stage
generates a design and spends runs.** `ofat` and `grid` live under `resolve/`
rather than `analyze/` for exactly that reason — they exist to buy new runs.

Binaries all land in `build/bin/` regardless of source location, so this layout
is free to evolve without breaking anything downstream.

## Status

**All twelve binaries above ship**, covering the funnel end to end: screening
through attribution, resolution, optimization, confirmation, response surfaces
and robust design, with the analyze stage alongside.

All suites pass under `-Werror`, valgrind and ASan/UBSan, with adversarial-input
coverage and parser fuzzing per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Coverage is 90.0%
lines / 100% functions.

**Claims are validated too, not just code.** [`validation/`](validation/README.md)
reproduces the published results this project relies on against closed-form
ground truth — which confirmed `sobol` implements the estimators its source
recommends, established where μ\* stops being a usable proxy for the total Sobol
index, and turned up an erratum in a 2007 paper's published table
([standalone reproduction](sources/campolongo-2007-morris-screening_erratum/)).

`sobol` samples with a **Joe-Kuo low-discrepancy sequence** by default
(`sampling: sobol`), built as its source specifies — matrices A and B are the
left and right halves of one 2k-dimensional sequence, not two draws. It is
bit-for-bit identical to the authors' own reference generator, and measured
against the same closed form it is 3× more accurate than Latin Hypercube at
N=256 and **66× at N=65536**.

Still to build: PCE surrogates and the two remaining sensitivity methods
(`pawn`, `--dgsm`); see [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).

## Driving these tools from another program

**Every command that emits a design, a ranking, a measurement or a
recommendation takes `--json`**, and that is the interface:

| stage | commands |
|---|---|
| screen | `morris analyze`, `morris bifurcate` |
| attribute | `sobol analyze` |
| resolve | `ofat`, `grid` |
| optimize | `taguchi generate`, `taguchi analyze`, `taguchi effects`, `taguchi confirm`, `taguchi robust`, `taguchi list-arrays`, `rsm analyze` |
| analyze | `regress`, `uq` |
| orchestrate | `robust screen`, `robust funnel` (`--json PATH`, or `-` for stdout) |
| present | `report` reads those documents |

`morris sample`, `sobol sample`, `taguchi generate --csv` and the `pareto`
commands emit CSV by design, and `validate` answers with its exit status.

The text tables are a display for people. They are laid out to stay positionally
parseable, but they will keep changing, and a program that parses them will keep
breaking — so parse the JSON, and check its `schema`, which is bumped only when
a key is renamed or removed.

Every document leads with `tool`, `command` and `schema`, so a consumer can
identify what it is holding before it reads a field. Documents also carry the
run count they were computed from — `runs` — because a ranking is only as good
as the rows behind it, and knowing there were nine of them is how you tell a
complete analysis from a partial one.

Diagnostics — near-tie cuts, overlapping intervals, an all-inert result — go to
**stderr in every mode**, so `--json` never buys a clean-looking document at the
price of the warning that made it worth reading.

<details>
<summary>Why this is a contract and not a convenience</summary>

`morris analyze` once printed μ\* glued to its new confidence interval
(`215.6[210,221]`). A downstream tool split each row on whitespace, failed to
parse *every* row identically, and read the resulting empty ranking as "no
factors matter" — so it skipped its screening stage after paying for hours of
real benchmark runs, with nothing erroring and nothing warning.

That is why the tables are no longer the interface. See
[screen/morris/README.md](screen/morris/README.md#--json--the-machine-readable-contract).
